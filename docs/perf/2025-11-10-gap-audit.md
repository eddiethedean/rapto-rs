# Gap Audit — 2025-11-10

## Reducers
- `rust/src/reduce/tiled.rs` handles both global and axis reducers.
- Float32 global reducers still rely on f64 accumulators; axis reducers fall back to sequential tiled loops without dedicated column kernels.
- Parallel path engages when `rows >= spec.row_block * 2`, leading to Rayon overhead for 512²/1024² shapes.

## SIMD Kernels
- `rust/src/simd/mod.rs` exposes lane-specific AVX2/AVX-512/NEON helpers.
- No dedicated column kernels for float32 axis-0; broadcast and scale share generic helpers lacking prefetch/unroll variants.

## Benchmarks
- Refreshed baselines (`benchmarks/baselines/*`) from latest runs with `RAPTORS_THREADS=8`, SIMD forced.
- Added targeted harness `benchmarks/run_axis0_suite.py` to snapshot `mean_axis0` across 512²/1024²/2048².
- Measurements captured in `benchmarks/results/latest_simd.json`, `latest_scalar.json`, and `benchmarks/results/axis0_latest.json`.
- Float32 axis-0 mean remains slower (≈0.7–0.9×) despite telemetry updates; float64 axis-0 now ≥1.0× for 1024²+ after policy tweaks.
- Column broadcast telemetry is now persisted as part of the adaptive heuristics, making it safe to iterate on float32 scheduling without regressing the fast-path SIMD cases.
